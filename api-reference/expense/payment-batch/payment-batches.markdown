### Version

1.2 for POST method

## <a name="getpaymentbatches"></a>Retrieve the list of payment batches

Retrieves the list of payment batches with an optional requested status.

    GET /expense/paymentbatch/v1.1/batchlist/


### Parameters

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------| ------ | --------------
`batchlist`|`string` | | **Required.** The batchlist keyword.
`Status` | `Boolean` |  | The status of the batches. Can be either OPEN or CLOSED.


### Response

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------| ------ | --------------
`BatchName`|`string` | | The batch name, as it appears in Payment Manager.
`BatchID`|`string` | | The unique identifier for the batch.
`BatchTotal`|`Decimal` | | The batch total amount.
`Currency`|`string` | | The [3-letter ISO 4217 currency code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) for the batch.
`Count`|`string` | | The number of payment demands in the batch.
`Type`|`string` | | The payee of the batch. Either Employee or Card Program.
`PaymentMethod`|`string` | | The reimbursement method for the batch. Either Expense Pay by Concur, Company Check (via Accounts Payable), ADP (via EPIP file), or Other Reimbursement Methods.
`Batch-URL`|`string` | | The URL to use as a basis for other actions, such as closing the batch.


## <a name="closepaymentbatch"></a>Close a payment batch

This request closes the specified batch, preventing any new expenses from entering it. After the batch closes, Concur creates the batch file containing the expense transaction information. If a batch ID for an already closed batch is sent, Concur regenerates the batch file for the specified batch. A batch can only be closed if it is currently open. A batch cannot be closed via API if it was already closed via the UI. The File-URL is only available for batches closed via the API and is used for retrieving the extract file or files. The URL will return the expense transaction data in text/csv format if there was a single file produced or as a zip archive if the batch is configured to produce more than one file. An example of a client who will receive multiple files is a client using QuickBooks, who receives one file formatted for import into QuickBooks (.IIF extension), and one file for the general ledger (.CSV extension), inside a .ZIP file.

    POST /expense/paymentbatch/v1.2/batch/{BatchID}/closed


### Parameters

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------| ------ | --------------
`BatchID`|`string` | | **Required.** The unique identifier for the batch.
`close` | `string` |  | **Required.** The close keyword


### Response
